        We are a team of creatives who have a fun idea, called Nichely!<br/><br/>

        Nichely is a cool way to post events for your favorite, invite your old friends and make new ones too.<br/><br/>

        Facebook might be building the metaverse, but we still have interests that require going out and meeting up in person.<br/><br/>

        Feel free to post your gaming events, crypto networking meetups, art groups, reading clubs, sports games, and more!<br/><br/>
